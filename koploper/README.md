# Train-the-Train

This it the start of a ambitious new project, writing an alternative for (parts of) the Koploper application.

* Open Source
* Python
* Modular architecture
* Runs on MacOS, Linux and Windows
* Read/write of existing Koploper files
* Other file storage in JSON/XML
* Implementing Z21, DCC and Dinamo procotols. Easy adding more in a later stage. 
* Using existing tools (such as graph editors for layout drawing)
* Split functions into
	* Layout editors
	* Edit/Read/write of database file
	* Network/online
	* Driving, running, planning
	* Simulation
	
### Options future development

* AI training of train flows
