# DCC-Z21
This repository contains Python sources that allow to connect with DCC-Z21 equipment such a DR5000 and LokSound5 decoders;
The sources describe Python classes for typilcal objects and protocols. By importing the classes in environments that run Python (such as scripting from MacOS terminal, DrawBot.com and webbrowsers) it is possible to define model train layouts and operation schedules entirely by code. No other 3rd-party applications are necessary.

This is an initial project start. More outlines for future development will be posted soon.

The development is done on MacOS, but since most Python code will only use standard labraries, it should not be a problem to run on Windows or Linux.
