# DCC-Z21
This repository contains Python sources to connect with DCC-Z21 equipment such a DR5000 and LokSound5 decoders;
The sources describe Python classes for typilcal objects and protocols. By importing the classes in envuronments that run Python (such as scripting from MacOS terminal and DrawBot.com and webbrowsers) it is possible to define model train layouts and operation schedcules entire in code. No other 3rd-party tools are necessary.

This is an initial project start. More outlines for future development will be posted soon.

The development is done on MacOS, but since most Python code will only use standard labraries, it should not be a problem to get it running on Windows or Linux.
